# Student Academic Achievement Analysis

## Project Overview
A comprehensive data science project analyzing factors that influence student academic performance using Python, statistical analysis, and data visualization techniques.

## Research Questions
1. **What factors most strongly predict exam performance?**
2. **How do study habits (hours studied) impact academic achievement?**
3. **What's the relationship between parental involvement and student success?**

## Dataset Information
- **Size**: 6,607 student records
- **Variables**: 20+ factors including study hours, attendance, parental involvement, school type
- **Target**: Exam scores (range: 55-101 points)
- **Quality**: Zero missing values, clean dataset

## Key Findings
- **Previous Scores**: Strongest predictor (correlation > 0.9)
- **Study Hours**: 19+ point improvement from low to high study hours
- **Parental Involvement**: 10+ point boost with high involvement
- **Attendance**: Critical factor for academic success

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development environment
- **Statistical Analysis**: Correlation analysis and hypothesis testing

## Visualizations Created

- Scatter plots with regression lines
- Bar charts for categorical analysis
- Box plots for performance comparisons

## Key Results
- Identified top 5 predictive factors for student success
- Created actionable recommendations for students, educators, and parents
- Developed statistical models showing factor relationships
- Generated comprehensive visualizations for insights

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Install required packages: `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter`
3. Open `notebooks/Student_Academic_Achievement_Analysis.ipynb`
