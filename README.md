# Student Academic Achievement Analysis

##  Project Overview
A comprehensive data science project analyzing factors that influence student academic performance using Python, statistical analysis, and data visualization techniques.

##  Research Questions
1. **What factors most strongly predict exam performance?**
2. **How do study habits (hours studied) impact academic achievement?**
3. **What's the relationship between parental involvement and student success?**

## Dataset Information
- **Size**: 6,607 student records
- **Variables**: 20+ factors including study hours, attendance, parental involvement, school type
- **Target**: Exam scores (range: 55-101 points)
- **Quality**: Zero missing values, clean dataset

## Key Findings
- **Previous Scores**: Strongest predictor (correlation > 0.9)
- **Study Hours**: 19+ point improvement from low to high study hours
- **Parental Involvement**: 10+ point boost with high involvement
- **Attendance**: Critical factor for academic success

- Distribution plots
- Scatter plots with regression lines
- Bar charts for categorical analysis
- Box plots for performance comparisons

## Key Results
- Identified top 5 predictive factors for student success
- Created actionable recommendations for students, educators, and parents
- Developed statistical models showing factor relationships
- Generated comprehensive visualizations for insights

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Install required packages: `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter`
3. Open `notebooks/Student_Academic_Achievement_Analysis.ipynb`
4. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis

## Dataset Information
- **Size**: 6,607 student records
- **Source**: [Student Success Factors Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anassarfraz13/student-success-factors-and-insights?resource=download)
- **Variables**: 20+ factors including study hours, attendance, parental involvement, school type
- **Target**: Exam scores (range: 55-101 points)
- **Quality**: Zero missing values, clean dataset

## Why This Problem Matters
Student academic achievement analysis is critical for:
- **Educational Policy**: Evidence-based decision making for schools
- **Student Success**: Identifying key factors for academic improvement
- **Resource Allocation**: Optimizing educational investments
- **Early Intervention**: Preventing academic failure through predictive insights

## Implementation Steps
1. **Data Collection**: Obtained comprehensive student dataset from Kaggle
2. **Data Exploration**: Statistical analysis and visualization of key variables
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Identified strongest predictive factors
4. **Categorical Analysis**: Compared performance across different student groups
5. **Visualization**: Created comprehensive charts and heatmaps
6. **Reporting**: Generated academic LaTeX report with findings

## Project Limitations
- **Cross-sectional Data**: Single time point limits causal inference
- **Self-reported Variables**: Potential bias in survey responses
- **Geographic Scope**: Results may not generalize to all educational systems
- **Missing Factors**: Teacher quality, curriculum differences not included
- **Sample Demographics**: May not represent all socioeconomic groups
