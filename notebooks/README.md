# Student Academic Achievement Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview
A comprehensive data science project analyzing factors that influence student academic performance using Python, statistical analysis, and data visualization techniques.

## 🎯 Research Questions
1. **What factors most strongly predict exam performance?**
2. **How do study habits (hours studied) impact academic achievement?**
3. **What's the relationship between parental involvement and student success?**

## 📈 Dataset Information
- **Size**: 6,607 student records
- **Variables**: 20+ factors including study hours, attendance, parental involvement, school type
- **Target**: Exam scores (range: 55-101 points)
- **Quality**: Zero missing values, clean dataset

## 🔍 Key Findings
- **Previous Scores**: Strongest predictor (correlation > 0.9)
- **Study Hours**: 19+ point improvement from low to high study hours
- **Parental Involvement**: 10+ point boost with high involvement
- **Attendance**: Critical factor for academic success
